# About

The National Horticultural Credit Association (NHCA) is a non-profit society registered in British Columbia for the purpose of engaging in a constructive exchange of information pertaining to their delinquent accounts receivables and members’ credit policy. Monthly reports are distributed so that members can make informed decisions regarding credit worthiness. The ultimate goal is to reduce bad debt in the horticulture industry.

# History

Two regional credit associations, the Western Nurserymen’s Credit Reporting Service and the Nurserymen’s Credit Exchange Inc. Ontario merged in January 2000 to become the NHCA. This combination resulted in a much stronger association giving valuable information to those companies selling across the country. 

# Testimonials

> The annual membership dues are a bargain, even if they only save you from one bad account per year!
